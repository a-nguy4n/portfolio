        <p> Hello! My name is Allison Nguyen. I’m currently a student at the University of California, San Diego,
                majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Design. I chose to study Computer Engineering because 
                I enjoy working with both software and hardware. This field gives me the opportunity to turn my ideas 
                into real projects, blending logic with creativity.</p>

        <p> Throughout my undergraduate career, I’ve worked on a variety of class projects that allowed me to explore 
            the full process: communicating ideas, designing solutions, and implementing them through both software 
            and hardware. As such, I aspire to become a product designer and engineer, combining creativity and technical 
            skills to build products that make a meaningful difference in people’s lives.</p>
        
        <p> Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time outdoors and discovering new places. I love exploring new coffee 
            shops and bakeries, hiking different trails, or simply listening to music while out on a walk.</p>
