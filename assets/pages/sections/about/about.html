        <h2> Allison Nguyen </h2>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m currently a student at the University of California, San Diego, majoring in Computer Engineering 
            and minoring in Design. I chose to study Computer Engineering because I enjoy working with both 
            software and hardware. This field gives me the opportunity to turn my ideas into real projects, blending 
            logic with creativity. <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout my undergraduate career, I’ve worked on a variety of class projects that allowed me to explore 
            the full process: communicating ideas, designing solutions, and implementing them through both 
            software and hardware.
